## Introduction

The Hypotenuse of a Triangle Calculator is a simple tool to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. This is especially useful for geometry students or developers looking to include trigonometric functions in their projects.
Features

    Simple and easy-to-use calculator for the hypotenuse of a triangle.
    Input two sides (base and height), and get the hypotenuse.
    Supports command-line interface (CLI) usage.
    Can be extended to include more features, such as angle calculation or UI support.

#  Usage

To calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, input the lengths of the two perpendicular sides (base and height). The program will return the length of the hypotenuse.
#  Example command:

Enter the base: 3
Enter the height: 4
The length of the hypotenuse is 5.0

The hypotenuse is calculated using the formula:
hypotenuse=base2+height2
hypotenuse=base2+height2
â€‹
Example

Given a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units, the hypotenuse would be 5 units. Here's an example output from the program:

bash

Base: 3
Height: 4
Hypotenuse: 5.0
